abstract: Streptococcus uberis is a common cause of intramammary infection and mastitis
  in dairy cattle. Unlike other mammary pathogens, S. uberis evades detection by mammary
  epithelial cells, and the host–pathogen interactions during early colonisation are
  poorly understood. Intramammary challenge of dairy cows with S. uberis (strain 0140J)
  or isogenic mutants lacking the surface-anchored serine protease, SUB1154, demonstrated
  that virulence was dependent on the presence and correct location of this protein.
  Unlike the wild-type strain, the mutant lacking SUB1154 failed to elicit IL-1β from
  ex vivo CD14+ cells obtained from milk (bovine mammary macrophages, BMM), but this
  response was reinstated by complementation with recombinant SUB1154; the protein
  in isolation elicited no response. Production of IL-1β was ablated in the presence
  of various inhibitors, indicating dependency on internalisation and activation of
  NLRP3 and caspase-1, consistent with inﬂammasome activation. Similar transcriptomic
  changes were detected in ex vivo BMM in response to the wild-type or the SUB1154
  deletion mutant, consistent with S. uberis priming BMM, enabling the SUB1154 protein
  to activate inﬂammasome maturation in a transcriptionally independent manner. These
  data can be reconciled in a novel model of pathogenesis in which, paradoxically,
  early colonisation is dependent on the innate response to the initial infection.
