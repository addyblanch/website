abstract: Dichelobacter nodosus (D. nodosus) is the causative pathogen of ovine footrot,
  a disease that has a signiﬁcant welfare and ﬁnancial impact on the global sheep
  industry. Previous studies into the phylogenetics of D. nodosus have focused on
  Australia and Scandinavia, meaning the current diversity in the United Kingdom (U.K.)
  population and its relationship globally, is poorly understood. Numerous epidemiological
  methods are available for bacterial typing; however, few account for whole genome
  diversity or provide the opportunity for future application of new computational
  techniques. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) measures nucleotide variations within
  several loci with slow accumulation of variation to enable the designation of allele
  numbers to determine a sequence type. The usage of whole genome sequence data enables
  the application of MLST, but also core and whole genome MLST for higher levels of
  strain discrimination with a negligible increase in experimental cost. An MLST database
  was developed alongside a seven loci scheme using publically available whole genome
  data from the sequence read archive. Sequence type designation and strain discrimination
  was compared to previously published data to ensure reproducibility. Multiple D.
  nodosus isolates from U.K. farms were directly compared to populations from other
  countries. The U.K. isolates deﬁne new clades within the global population of D.
  nodosus and predominantly consist of serogroups A, B and H, however serogroups C,
  D, E, and I were also found. The scheme is publically available at https://pubmlst.org/dnodosus/.
