abstract: Koala retrovirus (KoRV) is a recently endogenized retrovirus associated
  with neoplasia and immunosuppression in koala populations. The virus is known to
  display sequence variability and to be present at varying prevalence in different
  populations, with animals in southern Australia displaying lower prevalence and
  viral loads than northern animals. This study used a PCR and next-generation sequencing
  strategy to examine the diversity of the KoRV env gene in both proviral DNA and
  viral RNA forms in two distinct populations representative of the ‘northern’ and
  ‘southern’ koala genotypes. The current study demonstrated that the full range of
  KoRV subtypes is present across both populations, and in both healthy and sick animals.
  KoRV-A was the predominant proviral subtype in both populations, but there was marked
  diversity of DNA and RNA subtypes within individuals. Many of the northern animals
  displayed a higher RNA viral diversity than evident in their proviral DNA, indicating
  relatively higher replication efficiency of non-KoRV-A subtypes. The southern animals
  displayed a lower absolute copy number of KoRV than the northern animals as reported
  previously and a higher preponderance of KoRV-A in individual animals. These discrepancies
  in viral replication and diversity remain unexplained but may indicate relative
  protection of the southern population from KoRV replication due to either viral
  or host factors and may represent an important protective effect for the host in
  KoRV’s ongoing entry into the koala genome.
