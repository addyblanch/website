abstract: 'The primary objective of this study was to explore the variability of Streptococcus
  uberis (S. uberis) isolates by extracting multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data
  from whole-genome sequencing. The secondary objective was to determine the distribution
  of the phenotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the associated AMR genes as
  well as the virulence gene profiles among sequence types (STs). Sixty-two isolates
  were recovered from 16 herds in 3 Canadian Maritime Provinces: New Brunswick (14.5%),
  Nova Scotia (48.3%), and Prince Edward Island (37.1%). Of these, 9, 30, and 23 were
  recovered from post-calving, lactational samples, and post-mastitis samples, respectively.
  These 62 S. uberis isolates belonged to 34 STs; 11 isolates were typed to 9 known
  STs and 51 isolates were classified as one of 25 new STs. Thirteen isolates were
  part of major clonal complexes (CCs). Post-mastitis isolates contained 10 unique
  STs, lactational isolates contained 11 unique STs, and post-calving isolates had
  3 STs. Each farm had only 1 isolate that was a unique ST except for STs 233, 851,
  855, 857, 864, and 866, which were found in multiple cows per herd on more than
  one farm. ST851 and ST857 were found in each of the 3 sample types, with ST857 found
  in cows from all 3 Maritime provinces. These results indicate that S. uberis is
  a diverse non-clonal pathogen with specific STs residing in clonal clusters, carrying
  multiple AMR genes and virulence, with a diverse phenotypic AMR.'
