abstract: The Pragmatic Insertional Mutation Mapping (PIMMS) laboratory protocol was
  developed alongside various bioinformatics packages (Blanchard et al., 2015) to
  enable detection of essential and conditionally essential genes in Streptococcus
  and related bacteria. This extended the methodology commonly used to locate insertional
  mutations in individual mutants to the analysis of mutations in populations of bacteria.
  In Streptococcus uberis, a pyogenic Streptococcus associated with intramammary infection
  and mastitis in ruminants, the mutagen pGhost9:ISS1 was shown to integrate across
  the entire genome. Analysis of textgreater80,000 mutations revealed 196 coding sequences,
  which were not be mutated and a further 67 where mutation only occurred beyond the
  90th percentile of the coding sequence. These sequences showed good concordance
  with sequences within the database of essential genes and typically matched sequences
  known to be associated with basic cellular functions. Due to the broad utility of
  this mutagen and the simplicity of the methodology it is anticipated that PIMMS
  will be of value to a wide range of laboratories in functional genomic analysis
  of a wide range of Gram positive bacteria (Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus)
  of medical, veterinary, and industrial signiÔ¨Åcance.
