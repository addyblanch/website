abstract: Ovine footrot is a degenerative disease of sheep feet leading to the separation
  of hoofhorn from the underlying skin and lameness. This study quantitatively examined
  histological features of the ovine interdigital skin as well as their relationship
  with pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β) and virulent Dichelobacter nodosus in footrot.
  From 55 healthy and 30 footrot ovine feet, parallel biopsies (one fixed for histology)
  were collected post-slaughter and analysed for lesions and histopathological analysis
  using haematoxylin and eosin and Periodic Acid-Schiff. Histological lesions were
  similar in both conditions while inflammatory scores mirror IL-1β expression levels.
  Increased inflammatory score corresponded with high virulent D. nodosus load and
  was significant (p textless 0.0001) in footrot feet with an inflammatory score of
  3 compared to scores 1 and 2. In addition, in contrast to healthy tissues, localisation
  of eubacterial load extended beyond follicular depths in footrot samples. The novel
  inflammatory cell infiltration scoring system in this study may be used to grade
  inflammatory response in the ovine feet and demonstrated an association between
  severity of inflammatory response and increased virulent D. nodosus load.
