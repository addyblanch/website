abstract: P-glycoprotein (Pgp) represents the archetypal mechanism of drug resistance.
  But Pgp alone cannot expel drugs. A small but growing body of works has demonstrated
  that the membrane biophysical properties are central to Pgp-mediated drug resistance.
  For example, a change in the membrane surface pressure is expected to support drug–Pgp
  interaction. An interesting aspect from these models is that under speciﬁc conditions,
  the membrane is predicted to take over Pgp concerning the mechanism of drug resistance
  especially when the surface pressure is high enough, at which point drugs remain
  physically blocked at the membrane level. However it remains to be determined experimentally
  whether the membrane itself could, on its own, affect drug entry into cells that
  have been selected by a low concentration of drug and that do not express transporters.
  We demonstrate here that in the case of the drug doxorubicin, alteration of the
  surface pressure of membrane leaﬂets drive drug resistance.
