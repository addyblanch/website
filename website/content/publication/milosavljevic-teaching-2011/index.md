abstract: How do drugs cross the plasma membrane?‚Äù this may seem like a trivial question.
  This question is often overlooked to focus primarily on the different complex macro-molecular
  aspects involved in drug delivery or drug resistance. However, recent studies have
  highlighted the theme that to be fully understood, more knowledge of the underlying
  biology of the most complex biological processes involved in the delivery and resistance
  to drugs is needed. After all, why would a drug interact with a transporter then
  subsequently be excluded from P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expressing drug resistant cells?
  What are the determinants of this transition in behavior? Full consideration of
  the physical biology of drug delivery has allowed a better understanding of the
  reasons why specific membrane proteins are upregulated or overexpressed in drug
  resistant cells. This, in turn, allows us to identify new targets for drug chemicals.
  Better yet, it increases the significance of recents patents and underlines their
  importance in multi drug resistance.
