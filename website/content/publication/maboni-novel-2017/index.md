abstract: Skin infection studies are often limited by ﬁnancial and ethical constraints,
  and alternatives, such as monolayer cell culture, do not reﬂect many cellular processes
  limiting their application. For a more functional replacement, 3D skin culture models
  offer many advantages such as the maintenance of the tissue structure and the cell
  types present in the host environment. A 3D skin culture model can be set up using
  tissues acquired from surgical procedures or post slaughter, making it a cost effective
  and attractive alternative to animal experimentation. The majority of 3D culture
  models have been established for aerobic pathogens, but currently there are no models
  for anaerobic skin infections. Footrot is an anaerobic bacterial infection which
  affects the ovine interdigital skin causing a substantial animal welfare and ﬁnancial
  impact worldwide. Dichelobacter nodosus is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium and
  the causative agent of footrot. The mechanism of infection and host immune response
  to D. nodosus is poorly understood. Here we present a novel 3D skin ex vivo model
  to study anaerobic bacterial infections using ovine skin explants infected with
  D. nodosus. Our results demonstrate that D. nodosus can invade the skin explant,
  and that altered expression of key inﬂammatory markers could be quantiﬁed in the
  culture media. The viability of explants was assessed by tissue integrity (histopathological
  features) and cell death (DNA fragmentation) over 76 h showing the model was stable
  for 28 h. D. nodosus was quantiﬁed in all infected skin explants by qPCR and the
  bacterium was visualized invading the epidermis by Fluorescent in situ Hybridization.
  Measurement of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines/chemokines in the culture media revealed
  that the explants released IL1β in response to bacteria. In contrast, levels of
  CXCL8 production were no different to mock-infected explants. The 3D skin model
  realistically simulates the interdigital skin and has demonstrated that D. nodosus
  invades the skin and triggered an early cellular inﬂammatory response to this bacterium.
  This novel model is the ﬁrst of its kind for investigating an anaerobic bacterial
  infection.
