abstract: 'Background: Footrot and interdigital dermatitis are endemic infectious
  diseases in all sheep farming regions, impairing welfare and production. The development
  of efficacious vaccines against the primary causative pathogen has been hampered
  by the extensive antigenic diversity of Dichelobacter nodosus. Understanding the
  heterogeneity of the pathogen within and between flocks is essential if the feasibility
  of bespoke vaccine production is to be assessed for use in the U.K. Results: In
  this study 56 ewe and lamb isolates from 9 flocks were compared by D. nodosus serogroup
  and Multi Locus Sequence Type which provides significantly enhanced discriminatory
  power for molecular epidemiology. Serogroup heterogeneity between flocks ranged
  from two to five unique serogroups per flock. Three flocks contained isolates of
  two serogroups, two flocks contained isolates of three serogroups and one flock
  included isolates of five serogroups. Analysis of 25 isolates from one flock with
  high prevalence of lameness, identified that serogroup and sequence type was significantly
  correlated with age. Significantly higher proportion of lambs were infected with
  serogroup B (principally ST85) as opposed to serogroup H (principally ST86), which
  predominated amongst adult sheep. Conclusions: Genomic heterogeneity of the pathogen
  was significantly lower within flock compared to heterogenicity observed between
  flocks. Furthermore, this study indicates that within a flock, the host-pathogen
  dynamics and susceptibility to particular D. nodosus strains may be age dependent.'
