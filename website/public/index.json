Unlike other mammary pathogens, S. uberis evades detection by mammary epithelial cells, and the host–pathogen interactions during early colonisation are poorly understood. Intramammary challenge of dairy cows with S. uberis (strain 0140J) or isogenic mutants lacking the surface-anchored serine protease, SUB1154, demonstrated that virulence was dependent on the presence and correct location of this protein. Unlike the wild-type strain, the mutant lacking SUB1154 failed to elicit IL-1β from ex vivo CD14+ cells obtained from milk (bovine mammary macrophages, BMM), but this response was reinstated by complementation with recombinant SUB1154; the protein in isolation elicited no response. Production of IL-1β was ablated in the presence of various inhibitors, indicating dependency on internalisation and activation of NLRP3 and caspase-1, consistent with inﬂammasome activation. Similar transcriptomic changes were detected in ex vivo BMM in response to the wild-type or the SUB1154 deletion mutant, consistent with S. uberis priming BMM, enabling the SUB1154 protein to activate inﬂammasome maturation in a transcriptionally independent manner. These data can be reconciled in a novel model of pathogenesis in which, paradoxically, early colonisation is dependent on the innate response to the initial infection.","tags":[],"title":"A Paradox in Bacterial Pathogenesis: Activation of the Local Macrophage Inflammasome Is Required for Virulence of Streptococcus uberis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Morena Santi","Sharon A.

It has a particular tropism for the gravid uterus, however, the route of infection in reproductive tissues of ruminants (i.e. placentome), is much less clear. In this study, we aimed to investigate a bovine caruncular epithelial cell (BCEC) line as a model for L. monocytogenes infection of the bovine reproductive tract. The BCEC infection model was used to assess the ability of 14 different L. monocytogenes isolates to infect these cells. Lysozyme sensitivity and bacterial survival in 580 μg lysozyme/ml correlated with attenuated ability to proliferate in BCEC (p ¼ 0.004 and p ¼ 0.02, respectively). Four isolates were signiﬁcantly attenuated compared to the control strain 10403S. One of these strains (AR008) showed evidence of compromised cell wall leading to increased sensitivity to ß-lactam antibiotics, and another (7644) had compromised cell membrane integrity leading to increased sensitivity to cationic peptides. Whole genome sequencing followed by Multi Locus Sequence Type analysis identiﬁed that ﬁve invasive isolates had the same sequence type, ST59, despite originating from three different clinical conditions.

Herein, we sought to investigate the burden of antimicrobial resistance and diarrheal diseases, particularly Clostridioides difficile, in rural-agricultural and urban populations in Central India, where there is widespread unregulated antibiotic use. We utilized shotgun metagenomics to comprehensively characterize the bacterial and viral fractions of the gut microbiome and their encoded functions in 105 participants. Results: We observed distinct rural-urban differences in bacterial and viral populations, with geography exhibiting a greater influence than diarrheal status. Clostridioides difficile disease was more commonly observed in urban subjects, and their microbiomes were enriched in metabolic pathways relating to the metabolism of industrial compounds and genes encoding resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems. By linking phages present in the microbiome to their bacterial hosts through CRISPR spacers, phage variation could be directly related to shifts in bacterial populations, with the auxiliary metabolic potential of rural-associated phages enriched for carbon and amino acid energy metabolism. Conclusions: We report distinct differences in antimicrobial resistance gene profiles, enrichment of metabolic pathways and phage composition between rural and urban populations, as well as a higher burden of Clostridioides difficile disease in the urban population. Our results reveal that geography is the key driver of variation in urban and rural Indian microbiomes, with acute diarrheal disease, including C. difficile disease exerting a lesser impact. Future studies will be required to understand the potential role of dietary, cultural, and genetic factors in contributing to microbiome differences between rural and urban populations.","tags":[],"title":"Metagenomics reveals impact of geography and acute diarrheal disease on the Central Indian human gut microbiome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P L Davies","Adam M.

The development of efficacious vaccines against the primary causative pathogen has been hampered by the extensive antigenic diversity of Dichelobacter nodosus. Understanding the heterogeneity of the pathogen within and between flocks is essential if the feasibility of bespoke vaccine production is to be assessed for use in the U.K. Results: In this study 56 ewe and lamb isolates from 9 flocks were compared by D. nodosus serogroup and Multi Locus Sequence Type which provides significantly enhanced discriminatory power for molecular epidemiology. Serogroup heterogeneity between flocks ranged from two to five unique serogroups per flock. Three flocks contained isolates of two serogroups, two flocks contained isolates of three serogroups and one flock included isolates of five serogroups. Analysis of 25 isolates from one flock with high prevalence of lameness, identified that serogroup and sequence type was significantly correlated with age. Significantly higher proportion of lambs were infected with serogroup B (principally ST85) as opposed to serogroup H (principally ST86), which predominated amongst adult sheep. Conclusions: Genomic heterogeneity of the pathogen was significantly lower within flock compared to heterogenicity observed between flocks. Furthermore, this study indicates that within a flock, the host-pathogen dynamics and susceptibility to particular D. nodosus strains may be age dependent.","tags":[],"title":"Genomic heterogeneity of Dichelobacter nodosus within and between UK sheep flocks and between age groups within a flock","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurence M.

The virus is known to display sequence variability and to be present at varying prevalence in different populations, with animals in southern Australia displaying lower prevalence and viral loads than northern animals. This study used a PCR and next-generation sequencing strategy to examine the diversity of the KoRV env gene in both proviral DNA and viral RNA forms in two distinct populations representative of the ‘northern’ and ‘southern’ koala genotypes. The current study demonstrated that the full range of KoRV subtypes is present across both populations, and in both healthy and sick animals. KoRV-A was the predominant proviral subtype in both populations, but there was marked diversity of DNA and RNA subtypes within individuals. Many of the northern animals displayed a higher RNA viral diversity than evident in their proviral DNA, indicating relatively higher replication efficiency of non-KoRV-A subtypes. The southern animals displayed a lower absolute copy number of KoRV than the northern animals as reported previously and a higher preponderance of KoRV-A in individual animals. These discrepancies in viral replication and diversity remain unexplained but may indicate relative protection of the southern population from KoRV replication due to either viral or host factors and may represent an important protective effect for the host in KoRV’s ongoing entry into the koala genome.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic diversity of Koala retrovirus env gene subtypes: insights into northern and southern koala populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

This is largely due to the lack of a large ofﬂine gold-standard benchmark of relevant documents that cover a variety of research ﬁelds such that newly developed literature search techniques can be compared, improved and translated into practice. To overcome this bottleneck, we have established the RElevant LIterature SearcH consortium consisting of more than 1500 scientists from 84 countries, who have collectively annotated the relevance of over 180 000 PubMed-listed articles with regard to their respective seed (input) article/s. The majority of annotations were contributed by highly experienced, original authors of the seed articles. The collected data cover 76% of all unique PubMed Medical Subject Headings descriptors. No systematic biases were observed across different experience levels, research ﬁelds or time spent on annotations. More importantly, annotations of the same document pairs contributed by different scientists were highly concordant. We further show that the three representative baseline methods used to generate recommended articles for evaluation (Okapi Best Matching 25, Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency and PubMed Related Articles) had similar overall performances. Additionally, we found that these methods each tend to produce distinct collections of recommended articles, suggesting that a hybrid method may be required to completely capture all relevant articles. The established database server located at https://relishdb.ict.grifﬁth.edu.au is freely available for the downloading of annotation data and the blind testing of new methods. We expect that this benchmark will be useful for stimulating the development of new powerful techniques for title and title/abstract-based search engines for relevant articles in biomedical research.","tags":[],"title":"Large expert-curated database for benchmarking document similarity detection in biomedical literature search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julian Reyes","Juan C Rodriguez-Lecompte","Adam Blanchard","J T McClure","Javier Sánchez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610545098,"objectID":"af1c26069d9623ee88622c249e4c1df8","permalink":"/publication/reyes-molecular-2019/","publishdate":"2021-01-13T13:38:18.680386Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reyes-molecular-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The primary objective of this study was to explore the variability of Streptococcus uberis (S. uberis) isolates by extracting multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data from whole-genome sequencing.

From 55 healthy and 30 footrot ovine feet, parallel biopsies (one fixed for histology) were collected post-slaughter and analysed for lesions and histopathological analysis using haematoxylin and eosin and Periodic Acid-Schiff. Histological lesions were similar in both conditions while inflammatory scores mirror IL-1β expression levels. Increased inflammatory score corresponded with high virulent D. nodosus load and was significant (p textless 0.0001) in footrot feet with an inflammatory score of 3 compared to scores 1 and 2. In addition, in contrast to healthy tissues, localisation of eubacterial load extended beyond follicular depths in footrot samples. The novel inflammatory cell infiltration scoring system in this study may be used to grade inflammatory response in the ovine feet and demonstrated an association between severity of inflammatory response and increased virulent D. nodosus load.","tags":[],"title":"Novel inflammatory cell infiltration scoring system to investigate healthy and footrot affected ovine interdigital skin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam M.

Previous studies into the phylogenetics of D. nodosus have focused on Australia and Scandinavia, meaning the current diversity in the United Kingdom (U.K.) population and its relationship globally, is poorly understood. Numerous epidemiological methods are available for bacterial typing; however, few account for whole genome diversity or provide the opportunity for future application of new computational techniques. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) measures nucleotide variations within several loci with slow accumulation of variation to enable the designation of allele numbers to determine a sequence type. The usage of whole genome sequence data enables the application of MLST, but also core and whole genome MLST for higher levels of strain discrimination with a negligible increase in experimental cost. An MLST database was developed alongside a seven loci scheme using publically available whole genome data from the sequence read archive. Sequence type designation and strain discrimination was compared to previously published data to ensure reproducibility. Multiple D. nodosus isolates from U.K. farms were directly compared to populations from other countries. The U.K. isolates deﬁne new clades within the global population of D. nodosus and predominantly consist of serogroups A, B and H, however serogroups C, D, E, and I were also found. The scheme is publically available at https://pubmlst.org/dnodosus/.","tags":[],"title":"The Applied Development of a Tiered Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) Scheme for Dichelobacter nodosus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Grazieli Maboni","Rebecca Davenport","Kate Sessford","Kerstin Baiker","Tim K.

For a more functional replacement, 3D skin culture models offer many advantages such as the maintenance of the tissue structure and the cell types present in the host environment. A 3D skin culture model can be set up using tissues acquired from surgical procedures or post slaughter, making it a cost effective and attractive alternative to animal experimentation. The majority of 3D culture models have been established for aerobic pathogens, but currently there are no models for anaerobic skin infections. Footrot is an anaerobic bacterial infection which affects the ovine interdigital skin causing a substantial animal welfare and ﬁnancial impact worldwide. Dichelobacter nodosus is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium and the causative agent of footrot. The mechanism of infection and host immune response to D. nodosus is poorly understood. Here we present a novel 3D skin ex vivo model to study anaerobic bacterial infections using ovine skin explants infected with D. nodosus. Our results demonstrate that D. nodosus can invade the skin explant, and that altered expression of key inﬂammatory markers could be quantiﬁed in the culture media. The viability of explants was assessed by tissue integrity (histopathological features) and cell death (DNA fragmentation) over 76 h showing the model was stable for 28 h. D. nodosus was quantiﬁed in all infected skin explants by qPCR and the bacterium was visualized invading the epidermis by Fluorescent in situ Hybridization. Measurement of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines/chemokines in the culture media revealed that the explants released IL1β in response to bacteria. In contrast, levels of CXCL8 production were no different to mock-infected explants. The 3D skin model realistically simulates the interdigital skin and has demonstrated that D. nodosus invades the skin and triggered an early cellular inﬂammatory response to this bacterium. This novel model is the ﬁrst of its kind for investigating an anaerobic bacterial infection.","tags":[],"title":"A Novel 3D Skin Explant Model to Study Anaerobic Bacterial Infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Grazieli Maboni","Adam Blanchard","Sara Frosth","Ceri Stewart","Richard Emes","Sabine Tötemeyer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610545099,"objectID":"a22f6ee49a988ab5b8a14dc0235c5578","permalink":"/publication/maboni-distinct-2017/","publishdate":"2021-01-13T13:38:19.631215Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maboni-distinct-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A distinct bacterial dysbiosis associated skin inflammation in ovine footrot","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam M.

This extended the methodology commonly used to locate insertional mutations in individual mutants to the analysis of mutations in populations of bacteria. In Streptococcus uberis, a pyogenic Streptococcus associated with intramammary infection and mastitis in ruminants, the mutagen pGhost9:ISS1 was shown to integrate across the entire genome. Analysis of textgreater80,000 mutations revealed 196 coding sequences, which were not be mutated and a further 67 where mutation only occurred beyond the 90th percentile of the coding sequence. These sequences showed good concordance with sequences within the database of essential genes and typically matched sequences known to be associated with basic cellular functions. Due to the broad utility of this mutagen and the simplicity of the methodology it is anticipated that PIMMS will be of value to a wide range of laboratories in functional genomic analysis of a wide range of Gram positive bacteria (Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus) of medical, veterinary, and industrial signiﬁcance.","tags":[],"title":"PIMMS (Pragmatic Insertional Mutation Mapping System) Laboratory Methodology a Readily Accessible Tool for Identification of Essential Genes in Streptococcus","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["IDRC"],"title":"Disease intervention targets for porcine Streptococcus suis infections in Vietnam","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["BBSRC"],"title":"Prediction of phenotype from genotype with respect to bacterial infection","type":"project"},{"authors":["Adam Blanchard","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

But Pgp alone cannot expel drugs. A small but growing body of works has demonstrated that the membrane biophysical properties are central to Pgp-mediated drug resistance. For example, a change in the membrane surface pressure is expected to support drug–Pgp interaction. An interesting aspect from these models is that under speciﬁc conditions, the membrane is predicted to take over Pgp concerning the mechanism of drug resistance especially when the surface pressure is high enough, at which point drugs remain physically blocked at the membrane level. However it remains to be determined experimentally whether the membrane itself could, on its own, affect drug entry into cells that have been selected by a low concentration of drug and that do not express transporters. We demonstrate here that in the case of the drug doxorubicin, alteration of the surface pressure of membrane leaﬂets drive drug resistance.","tags":[],"title":"Importance of the Difference in Surface Pressures of the Cell Membrane in Doxorubicin Resistant Cells That do not Express Pgp and ABCG2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam Blanchard","Cyril Rauch"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1317427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610545099,"objectID":"e3d61d61a828145917de71d6456d081f","permalink":"/publication/devaux-membrane-2011/","publishdate":"2021-01-13T13:38:19.222246Z","relpermalink":"/publication/devaux-membrane-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Membrane Lipid Asymmetry and Permeability to Drugs: A Matter of Size","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nina Milosavljevic","Adam Blanchard","Miriam L.

This question is often overlooked to focus primarily on the different complex macro-molecular aspects involved in drug delivery or drug resistance. However, recent studies have highlighted the theme that to be fully understood, more knowledge of the underlying biology of the most complex biological processes involved in the delivery and resistance to drugs is needed. After all, why would a drug interact with a transporter then subsequently be excluded from P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expressing drug resistant cells? What are the determinants of this transition in behavior? Full consideration of the physical biology of drug delivery has allowed a better understanding of the reasons why specific membrane proteins are upregulated or overexpressed in drug resistant cells. This, in turn, allows us to identify new targets for drug chemicals. Better yet, it increases the significance of recents patents and underlines their importance in multi drug resistance.","tags":[],"title":"Teaching New Dogs Old Tricks: Membrane Biophysical Properties in Drug Delivery and Resistance","type":"publication"}]
